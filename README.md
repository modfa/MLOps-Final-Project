Problem to solve--- Predicitng the Price of pre-owned Cars

There is one XYZ e-commerce company and they act as mediators between parties who are interested in selling or buying a pre owned cars. Now these are second hand cars and XYZ company act as mediators. Now in specific for the year 2015 to 2016, XYZ company have
recorded the data about the seller and car details.

So, what XYZ e-commerce company wants to do is they want to develop an algorithm, so that they can predict the price of the cars based on various attributes associated with the car.

So, XYZ e-commerce company has data for about 50,000 cars in their database that have been sold or that have been processed in one way another and there are these 19 variables that are associated with this problem.
Clearly, one of these variables is going to be the outcome variable or the price of the car and the other variables are variables that we hope have enough information in them so that we can
basically predict the price of the car.

The detailed description of all the variables can be found in the {} jupyter notebook where we explored the dataset in depth.
